Common issues and resolution steps.

## Auto-login does not work

### Issue 1

You connect to a Windows host from the Teleport UI, land on the Windows login
screen and nothing happens.

You can click on the username, click `Sign-in options` and click on the smart
card icon. The error message is: **"No Valid Certificates Were Found on This
Smart Card"**.

### Solution 1

Usually, this means that the Smart Card service is not running on the target
host.

First, make sure that you [enable the Smart Card service in Group
Policy](./getting-started.mdx#enable-the-smart-card-service).

If that doesn't help, log into the target host directly, open the "Services"
program from the "Start" menu and check that the "Smart Card" service is in the
"Running" state.

If the "Smart Card" service is not running, open PowerShell and run
`gpupdate.exe /force`. This forces a Group Policy sync and should pick up the
service changes.

### Issue 2

You connect to a Windows host from the Teleport UI, land on the Windows login
screen and see an error message: **"The smartcard certificate used for
authentication was not trusted"** (or similar).

### Solution 2

This means that the host does not trust the Teleport CA.

First, make sure that you [import the Teleport CA into Group
Policy](./getting-started.mdx#import-teleport-ca). Note that if the
Teleport CA was rotated since the last import, you will have to fetch the
new CA using `tctl auth export --type=windows >user-ca.cer`

If that doesn't help, log into the target host directly, open PowerShell and
run `gpupdate.exe /force`. This forces a Group Policy sync and should pick up
the new CA.

## New session "hangs"

### Issue

You click `CONNECT` on a Windows host from the Teleport UI, a new tab opens but
nothing is displayed other than the top bar. After a while, an error is
displayed about a failed connection.

### Solution

This happens when the `windows_desktop_service` can't reach the target Windows
host.

First, make sure that you [open the RDP
port](./getting-started.mdx#open-firewall-to-inbound-rdp-connections) and [allow
remote RDP connections in Group
Policy](./getting-started.mdx#allow-remote-rdp-connections).

If that does not help, check if the target host is online and try to `ping` it
from the Linux server that runs `windows_desktop_service`. If the host is
online but not reachable, there is some other networking barrier in the way,
specific to your infrastructure.

## Teleport fails to start

### Issue 1

Teleport fails to start with an error similar to:

```text
LDAP Result Code 49 "Invalid Credentials": 80090308: LdapErr: DSID-0C0903C5, comment: AcceptSecurityContext error, data 52e, v2580\x00
```

### Solution 1

This means that your LDAP username and password were not correct. Double-check
them in the `ldap` section of `windows_desktop_service`.

Note that the LDAP username must be formatted as `DOMAIN\User`, where `DOMAIN`
is the NetBIOS name for the domain. For example, user `Administrator` in domain
`example.com` should be formatted as `EXAMPLE\Administrator`.

### Issue 2

Teleport fails to start with an error similar to:

```text
LDAP Result Code 10 "Referral": 0000202B: RefErr: DSID-0310082F, data 0, 1 access points
"\tref 1: 'xample.com'"
"\x00"
```

### Solution 2

This means that your domain name is likely wrong. Double-check the `domain`
field in the `ldap` section of `windows_desktop_service`.

### Issue 2

Teleport fails to start with an error similar to:

```text
LDAP Result Code 200 "Network Error": dial tcp ad.example.com:389: i/o timeout
```

### Solution 2

This means that your Domain Controller is down or unreachable. Double-check the
`addr` field in the `ldap` section of `windows_desktop_service`. If it's
correct, check that the Domain Controller is up and reachable from the server
that runs `windows_desktop_service`.

### Issue 3

Teleport fails to start with an error similar to:

```text
LDAP Result Code 52 "Unavailable": 00000000: LdapErr: DSID-0C090F78, comment: Error initializing SSL/TLS, data 0, v2580\x00
```

### Solution 3

This means that you do not have Active Directory Certificate Services (AD CS)
installed in your domain. AD CS provides the certificate for TLS connections to
LDAP and Teleport refuses to authenticate to LDAP over an insecure connection.

You must [install AD
CS](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/networking/core-network-guide/cncg/server-certs/install-the-certification-authority)
on one of the Domain Controllers and reboot it.
